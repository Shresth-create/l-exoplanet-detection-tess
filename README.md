# Exoplanet Detection Using Neural Networks

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow to detect exoplanets from NASAâ€™s TESS light curve data. Achieved an accuracy of over 96%.

## Features
- Preprocessing of light curve time-series data
- CNN architecture for binary classification (planet vs no-planet)
- Visualization of model performance

## How to Run
Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), upload your dataset, and run all cells.  
Notebook: exoplanet_detection_model.ipynb

## Dataset
Based on TESS light curve data. (Replace with link or description of how you simulated it if not using real TESS data)

## Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Google Colab
- Matplotlib / NumPy / Pandas
